# Algebra refresher

This is my attempt to complete the algebra refresher course from Udacity. I used [this](https://github.com/omarrayward/Linear-Algebra-Refresher-Udacity) repository as a reference and I checked out his notes heavily. If you ever come back searching for notes, check out his notes!
